# MP-ReID: A Multi-Modal, Multi-Platform Dataset for Person Re-Identification
![Header](teaser.png)

MP-ReID stands as the inaugural dataset specifically constructed for research in multi-modal and multi-platform person re-identification. Data collection for this dataset employed a dual-platform approach, utilizing both ground-based surveillance and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, the dataset incorporates three distinct modalities: RGB, thermal infrared, and near-infrared.

The creation of this comprehensive dataset spanned over four months of data acquisition and includes 1,930 unique person identities from 14 camera views with 136,156 bounding boxes.

MP-ReID encompasses a wealth of diverse pedestrian information, offering an invaluable resource for advancing research in multi-modal and multi-platform person re-identification.

## Data structure
The dataset has the following folder structure which will either be produced by the download or generation scripts.

The MP-ReID dataset is captured by 14 cameras, with each camera corresponding to a folder. Cameras 01-06 are ground-based RGB cameras, among which 01 and 03 are set up indoors, and the rest are set up outdoors. Cameras 07-12 are ground-based IR cameras, with 07 and 09 set up indoors, and the rest are set up outdoors. Camera 13 is a drone-based RGB camera, while camera 14 is a drone-based thermal camera.
## Data Split
Following the proposed experimental benchmarks, experiments are categorized into six distinct types. For each experiment type, separate training and testing sets have been designated. Pre-partitioned .txt files and a partitioning script are provided, allowing for custom re-partitioning if needed. You can find specific experimental divisions are recorded in the `split` folder. For example, exp_cctv_ir_cctv_rgb represents the experiment from infrared images collected by CCTV to the RGB images collected by CCTV. And you can find the script for spliting in `scripts` folder.
