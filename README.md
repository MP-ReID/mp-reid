## Abstract
Conventional person re-identification (ReID) research is often limited to single-modality sensor data from static cameras, which fails to address the complexities of real-world scenarios where multi-modal signals are increasingly prevalent. For instance, consider an urban ReID system integrating stationary RGB cameras, nighttime infrared sensors, and UAVs equipped with dynamic tracking capabilities. Such systems face significant challenges due to variations in camera perspectives, lighting conditions, and sensor modalities, hindering effective person ReID. To address these challenges, we introduce the MP-ReID benchmark, a novel dataset designed specifically for multi-modality and multi-platform ReID. This benchmark uniquely compiles data from 1,930 identities across diverse modalities, including RGB, infrared, and thermal imaging, captured by both UAVs and ground-based cameras in indoor and outdoor environments. Building on this benchmark, we introduce Uni-Prompt ReID, a framework with specific-designed prompts, tailored for cross-modality and cross-platform scenarios. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a robust foundation for future research in complex and dynamic ReID environments.
